  # Run the global hooks associated with a particular +name+ passing all +args+ to the registered block.
  #
  # == Before / After hooks
  #
  # If this is invoked for before / after hooks (i.e. no block is passed), then the
  # hooks will be invoked in the order in which they're defined.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   add_hook(:before_fork) {|worker| puts 1 }
  #   add_hook(:before_fork) {|worker| puts 2 }
  #   add_hook(:before_fork) {|worker| puts 3 }
  #
  #   run_hooks_for(:before_fork, worker)
  #
  #   # ...will produce the following output
  #   => 1
  #   => 2
  #   => 3
  #
  # == Around hooks
  #
  # If this is invoked for around hooks (i.e. a block is passed), then the hooks
  # will be invoked in the order in which they're defined, with the passed block
  # being invoked last after the hooks yield.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   add_hook(:around_fork) {|worker, &block| puts 'before 1'; block.call; puts 'after 1'}
  #   add_hook(:around_fork) {|worker, &block| puts 'before 2'; block.call; puts 'after 2'}
  #   add_hook(:around_fork) {|worker, &block| puts 'before 3'; block.call; puts 'after 3'}
  #
  #   run_hooks_for(:around_fork, worker) { puts 'block' }
  #
  #   # ...will produce the following output
  #   => before 1
  #   => before 2
  #   => before 3
  #   => block
  #   => after 3
  #   => after 2
  #   => after 1
  #
  # You can imagine the callback order to be U shaped where logic *prior* to yielding
  # is called in the order it's defined and logic *after* yielding is called in
  # reverse order.  At the bottom of the U is when the block passed into +run_hooks_for+
  # gets invoked.
  def self.run_hooks_for(name,*args,&block)

      run_around_hooks_for(name, args, &block)

      hooks = self.hooks_for(name)

        end
      else
        # There are no more hooks: call the black passed into +run_hooks_for+.

  # Configure global chore options. Takes a hash for +opts+.
  # This includes things like the current Worker Strategy (+:worker_strategy+), the default Consumer (+:consumer+), and the default Consumer Strategy(+:consumer_strategy).
  # It's safe to call multiple times (will merge the new config, into the old)
  # This is used by the command line parsing code to setup Chore.
  # If a +block+ is given, <tt>configure</tt> will yield the config object, so you can set options directly.
  # === Examples
  #   Chore.configure({:worker_strategy => Chore::ForkedWorkerStrategy})
  #
  #   Chore.configure do |c|
  #     c.consumer = Chore::Queues::SQS::Consumer
  #     c.batch_size = 50
  #     c.batch_timeout = 20
